         The following app visualize and analize the model built for the Kaggle Competition
         [Tabular Playground Series - Oct 2022](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/hyperlink-in-streamlit-without-markdown/7046/3).
         The challenge was to predict the probability of each team scoring within the next 10 seconds of the game given a snapshot from a Rocket League match.
         More information and the data used is available on the link. 
         
         The code for the data exploration and training is available in [this Github repository](https://github.com/gbournigal/rocket_league).
         
         This app will focus on the model selected and to see what probabilities it predicts to different games.
